Testing in Terminal Fighter is done with googletest and googlemock, the header files `gmock` and `gtest` must be added to your include path.
A good location is in `/usr/local/include`.
You must compile the library that has the definitions yourself. 
Meaning you need a `libgmock.a` archive file in this directory in order to compile the tests. 

To create a `libgmock.a` file follow these instructions in an arbitrary dir.

1. Get the googletest and googlemock source code:
	`git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git`

2. Go into the cloned directory 
	`cd googletest/`

3. Compile googletest:	
	`g++ -isystem googletest/include/ -Igoogletest -isystem googlemock/include/ -Igooglemock -pthread -c googletest/src/gtest-all.cc`

4. Compile googlemock:
	`g++ -isystem googletest/include/ -Igoogletest -isystem googlemock/include/ -Igooglemock -pthread -c googlemock/src/gmock-all.cc`

5. Collect both the resulting .o files into an archive file:
	`ar -rv libgmock.a gtest-all.o gmock-all.o`

Congratulations! You now have a `libgmock.a` archive file, now include it in the `TerminalFighter/test/` directory and you should be good to go, run `make` in the test directory to check if you can compile the tests.
